This program is my first assignment in my programming journey.
This program is in C++ language. it's about calculating whether a frog can cross a certain distance based on 3 arguments; 
D: the total distance to calculate.
S: the initial jump distance.
K: the limit before the frog rests. 
After every 5 jumps, the frog gets tired and jumps less far. 
When the jumps get too short, the frog takes a break.
